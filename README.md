# Statistical-Model-for-Predicting-Neonatal-Weight
Company: Neonatal Health Solutions

Objective: Create a statistical model that accurately predicts newborn birth weight, based on clinical variables collected from three hospitals. The project aims to improve the management of high-risk pregnancies, optimize hospital resources and ensure better neonatal health outcomes.

The project is part of a growing focus on preventing neonatal complications. The ability to predict newborn birth weight represents a key opportunity to improve clinical planning and reduce the risks associated with problematic births, such as premature births or low birth weight newborns. The main benefits that this project will bring to the company and the healthcare sector are:

1. Improvement of clinical predictions: Newborn weight is a key indicator of their health. Having an accurate predictive model allows medical personnel to intervene promptly in case of anomalies, reducing perinatal complications such as breathing difficulties or hypoglycemia.

2. Optimization of hospital resources: Knowing in advance which newborns may need intensive care helps organize the human and technological resources of hospitals efficiently. This translates into a reduction in operating costs and better planning of the use of neonatal intensive care units (NICUs).

3. Prevention and identification of risk factors: The model will be able to highlight the factors that most negatively influence the weight of the newborn (such as maternal smoking, multiple pregnancies or advanced maternal age). This information is valuable for the prevention and personalized management of pregnancies, allowing proactive interventions in case of high risk.

4. Evaluation of hospital practices: Through a comparative analysis between the three hospitals involved, the company will be able to identify any differences in clinical results, such as a higher incidence of cesarean sections in a given facility. This allows monitoring the quality of practices and harmonizing protocols between different hospital centers, improving the consistency of care.

5. Support for strategic planning: Data analytics and forecasts can be used to inform not only clinical but also strategic decisions. The company will be able to leverage this information to implement new public health policies, ensuring a positive impact on neonatal mortality and morbidity rates.
